SoNNia is a python 3.6 software which extends the functionality of the [SONIA](https://github.com/statbiophys/SONIA).  It  expands  the  choice  of selection  models  to  infer,  by  adding  non  linear  single-chain models and (non-)linear paired-chain models.  The pre-processing pipeline implemented in the corresponding paper is also included  in  the  package  as  a  separate  class.


## Version
Latest released version: 0.0.1

## Installation
SONIA is a python /3.6 software. The package can be installed by using the setup.py script:

 ```python setup.py install```.
 
Sometimes pip fails to install the dependencies correctly. Thus, if you get any error try first to install the dependencies separately:
 ```
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
pip install olga
pip install sonia 
 ```
